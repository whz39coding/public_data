The data and materials provided herein are associated with the manuscript currently under review. They are shared exclusively for academic assessment and verification, and are **not intended for public reuse, redistribution, or commercial purposes**.

## data.csv
The "data.csv" file contains the descriptor data of the compounds that have been measured for their activity values as mentioned in the literature, as well as the transformed activity values($EC_{50}$).
f1-f4 represent the descriptor values.label represent the values of activity

## new_design.csv

The "new_design.csv" file contains the descriptor values of 94 new compounds designed based on the HM model. It also includes the relevant data of the existing compounds in the "data.csv" file. The format is the same as that of "data.csv". (The new designed compounds do not have real label values.)

## the .hin files

The "hin" folder contains the hin file format of the newly designed compounds during the experiment. From this, the structural formulas of the compounds can be obtained, and this file is utilized in the subsequent descriptor calculations.
